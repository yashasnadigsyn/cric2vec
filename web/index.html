                In the world of sports analytics, we are often drowning in aggregates: averages, strike rates, and
                economy rates. While useful, these metrics flatten the complexity of the game. They tell us
                <em>what</em> happened, but rarely <em>how</em> or <em>why</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cric2Vec</strong> is an attempt to move beyond aggregates. By treating a cricket match not as a
                spreadsheet of numbers but as a semantic sequence of events—much like language—we can use techniques
                from Natural Language Processing to learn rich, multi-dimensional representations of players.

            <h2>The Core Concept: Word2Vec for Cricket</h2>

                <div class="concept-text">
                    <h3>What is an Embedding?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Computers cannot understand raw text (like "King") or entities (like "Virat Kohli").
                        Traditional methods map these to simple ID numbers, but IDs have no meaning—ID #45 isn't
                        "closer" to ID #46 than ID #100.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Embeddings</strong> solve this by mapping every entity to a vector of numbers
                        (coordinates) in a high-dimensional space.
                        In this space, mathematical distance equals semantic similarity.

            <h3>The Language Analogy</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Word2Vec</strong> revolutionised NLP with a simple insight: <em>"You shall know a word by the
                    company it keeps."</em>
                (The Distributional Hypothesis). The word "Banking" appears in similar contexts to "Finance", so their
                vectors move closer together during training.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cric2Vec</strong> applies this exact logic to Cricket:

                Just as <code>King - Man + Woman = Queen</code> works in word vectors, we find that
                <strong><code>Kohli - Anchor + Finisher ≈ Dhoni</code></strong> holds true in our cricket vectors.

            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                This project builds directly upon the foundational ideas introduced in two key research papers:
                <strong>Batter|Pitcher2Vec</strong> and <strong>NBA2Vec</strong>. These works demonstrated that the
                "distributional hypothesis" in linguistics—that a word is characterized by the company it keeps—applies
                equally well to athletes.
            </p>

            <div class="paper-comparison">
                <div class="paper-block">
                    <h3>Batter|Pitcher2Vec</h3>
                    <p>
                        This research brought the Word2Vec architecture to Major League Baseball. By treating the
                        batter-pitcher duel as a predictive task, the model learned representations that captured subtle
                        nuances of gameplay. For instance, without being explicitly told about pitch types, the model
                        grouped pitchers who relied on heavy movement together. It proved that a neural network could
                        verify baseball intuition (e.g., specific lefty-righty matchups) purely from the raw sequence of
                        at-bats.

                    <h3>NBA2Vec</h3>
                    <p>
                        Expanding on this significantly, NBA2Vec modeled the more chaotic, 10-player environment of
                        basketball. It predicted possession outcomes based on the entire lineup on the court. The
                        critical insight here was that "positions" (Point Guard, Center) are often fluid. The embeddings
                        revealed that players cluster by <em>role</em> and <em>playing style</em> rather than their
                        nominal position on the scorecard.

                <p>
                    Cric2Vec takes these concepts to the cricket pitch. Cricket is uniquely suited for this: it combines
                    the dyadic nature of the batter-bowler contest (like Baseball) with the broader team context and
                    conditions (like Basketball).

                <p>
                    <strong>A Note on Intent:</strong> It is crucial to clarify what this project is <em>not</em>. We
                    are not building a betting engine. We are not trying to predict the winner of the next IPL or World
                    Cup match. If you want to know who will win, look at the odds. If you want to know <em>who a player
                        is</em>—mathematically, stylistically, and fundamentally—that is what Cric2Vec answers. We are
                    decoding the DNA of playing style.

            <h2>Methodology & Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Our core model, <strong>Cricket2VecV2</strong>, learns by attempting to predict the outcome of every
                ball (dot, single, boundary, wicket)
                given the context. We move beyond simple batter-bowler interactions by incorporating <strong>Team
                    Embeddings</strong>
                (capturing tactical styles like CSK's spin choke) and <strong>Venue Embeddings</strong> (distinguishing
                between the
                small boundaries of Chinnaswamy and the spin-friendly Chepauk).

            <h2>Beyond The Embeddings</h2>
            <p>The true power of Cric2Vec lies in its applications. By performing algebraic operations in this

                        construct the most "diverse" team possible.
                        Given a captain (e.g., Rohit Sharma), the model hunts for players who occupy orthogonal regions
                        of the vector space, ensuring
                        that every tactical base—from anchor to pinch-hitter—is covered.

            <h2>Visualizing the Space</h2>
            <p>
                When we project the high-dimensional player vectors down to 2D or 3D space (using t-SNE), clear clusters
                emerge without any manual labelling. We see "Aggressive Openers" grouping together, "Death Bowlers"
                forming their own island, and "Spinners" separating from "Pacers".
